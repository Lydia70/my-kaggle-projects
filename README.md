My Kaggle Notebooks

In this repository, I post some of my Kaggle contributions.

Recently, I made a task submission on Netflix TV Shows. I use content-based recommender systems as a machine learning technique. I recommend TV shows to watch next.

Also, I added a fabulous notebook about the weather in Australia. I created GEO Maps with Basemap, including the most popular Australian cities and the average rainfall in each city for each month. I have built a logistic regression model for both Sydney and Melbourne to predict the rainfall tomorrow. And Lastly, I predict the rainfall in April 2021 by using a time series forecasting analysis.

Enjoy reading my Kaggle notebooks!
